When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I intend to share my work with public.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    So I can have more control.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are clones made on GitHub from other's repositories to your new made repository (on GitHub).
    Clones are clones of some repository (local or remote) to new location mostly locally.
    Branches are branches emerging from master branch which are in the same repository.
    Forks and clones are used to copy other repository so you can make changes indenpendently from original source not interferring into that source.
    Branches are used to make changes beside master branch for experimental purposes, removing bugs, adding new features and similar processes and than incorporate them into master branch or if not wanted remove that branches with no impact on master branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    Benefit is in being up-to-date for new changes or improvements being added. And also it is easier to commit your changes to remote repository if your local copy is more updated.
